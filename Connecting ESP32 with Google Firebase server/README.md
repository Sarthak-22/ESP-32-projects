## CONNECTING ESP32 with GOOGLE FIREBASE REALTIME DATABASE
* In this project, we aim to control two LED's through Google's realtime database server called __Firebase__. The two LED's can be controlled by two object nodes created in the database. When the input String is "on", the LED switches on and vise versa.
* The detailed code is explained above with appropriate explaination for several important lines of code.
